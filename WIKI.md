**Training sequences (frame prefix):**
- **Short Training Sequence (STS):** 16-sample pattern repeated 10× → used for frame detection and coarse frequency offset correction.
- **Long Training Sequence (LTS):** 64-sample pattern repeated 2.5× → used for symbol alignment and channel estimation.

---
## 📖 Q2. Read Section 2.1 and understand what it means  
**Where are the mentioned tags?**

- **Stream tagging:** used to annotate the incoming sample stream with metadata such as:  
  - start of frame  
  - frame length  
  - modulation and coding scheme (MCS)  
- These tags allow the downstream blocks to know *where a frame begins, how long it is, and how to decode it*.  

- **Message passing:**  
  - Allows blocks to exchange complete packets (headers + payload) asynchronously.  
  - Makes it easier to handle MAC frames once they are extracted from the stream.  

- **VOLK (Vector Optimized Library of Kernels):**  
  - Uses SIMD instructions to speed up operations at high sampling rates (10–20 Msps).  
  - Provides portable and optimized performance across different CPUs.  

---

## 🧮 Q3. Work through Section 2.2  
**a) Identify the blocks that calculate the autocorrelation**  
- The autocorrelation is computed using the repeated structure of the STS (every 16 samples).  
- Implemented with a summation block:
```math   
  a[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{N_{win}-1} s[n+k] \cdot s[n+k+16]^* 
```

**b) Identify the blocks that calculate the power**  
- Power is calculated over the same window:
```math  
  p[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{N_{win}-1} |s[n+k]|^2 
```

**c) Try to obtain a graph like Figure 2**  
- The normalized autocorrelation coefficient is:  
```math  
    c[n] = \frac{|a[n]|}{p[n]}  
```
- A plateau in `c[n]` corresponds to the presence of the STS → this indicates the start of a frame.  

**d) Explore the effect of varying Nwin**  
- Small `Nwin`:  
  - Faster detection, but less robust (more noise sensitive).  
- Large `Nwin`:  
  - Smoother, more robust detection, but introduces delay.  
- The paper reports **Nwin = 48** as a good trade-off.

# 📡 IEEE 802.11a OFDM Receiver – Week 2 Notes

## Understand the OFDM Sync Short block

- The OFDM Sync Short block performs frame detection.
- It decides when a Wi-fi (802.11a) frame starts.

- It does this by detecting the short training sequence at the beginning of every OFDM frame.
- The short preamble consists of a 16-sample pattern repeated 10 times → this repetition makes the autocorrelation high during this section.

## What the Block Actually Does

-It receives: 
- The raw complex samples s[n]; 
- The normalized autocorrelation coefficient c[n];

-It:

1. **Monitors** the value of `c[n]` to detect the presence of the short training sequence.
2. **Confirms the start of a frame** when `c[n]` remains above the threshold for **≥ 3 consecutive samples**, ensuring the detection is stable and not triggered by noise.
3. **Opens a “valve”** and forwards a fixed number of samples to the subsequent blocks in the receive chain.
4. **If no plateau is detected**, all incoming samples are **discarded**.
-This block does not perform any decoding. Its sole function is to detect the start of a frame and forward the corresponding samples to the next processing stages.

## Meaning of the Threshold

Threshold is applied to the normalized autocorrelation:

𝑐[𝑛]=∣𝑎[𝑛]∣ / 𝑝[𝑛]

-𝑎[n]: autocorrelation over lag 16
-p[n]: average signal power

Interpretation:
- High c[n] → strong repetitive pattern present → likely short preamble.
- Low c[n] → random samples/no frame.

The threshold defines how “clear” the repetition must be to consider it a frame.

## Effect of Changing the Threshold

| Threshold Setting | Effect | Consequence |
|------------------|--------|-------------|
| **Too Low**       | Noise may exceed the threshold | **False detections** → the receiver forwards samples that do not belong to any valid frame → later processing fails |
| **Too High**      | The actual preamble may not exceed the threshold | **Frames are not detected** → reduced detection probability |
| **Optimal Setting** | Only the true short preamble consistently exceeds the threshold | **Stable and reliable** frame start detection |


### Effect of Window Size (`Nwin`) on Preamble Detection

| Window Size (`Nwin`) | Effect | Consequence |
|----------------------|--------|-------------|
| **Small**            | Less smoothing of the autocorrelation | `c[n]` becomes noisier → harder to identify a stable plateau |
| **Large**            | Greater smoothing of the autocorrelation | The plateau becomes flatter → detection reacts more slowly to transitions |


### Limitations of the OFDM Sync Short Approach

| Limitation | Description | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Fixed frame length** | The block forwards only a fixed number of samples after detecting the short preamble. | Only frames up to that maximum length can be decoded; longer frames are truncated. |
| **Cannot detect closely spaced frames** | While forwarding samples from one frame, the block does not look for a new plateau. | A following frame that arrives shortly after (e.g., **CTS** after **RTS**) may be missed. |
| **Parameter sensitivity** | Detection depends on proper threshold tuning and window size (`Nwin`) relative to SNR and channel conditions. | Poor parameter selection may lead to **false detections** or **missed frames**. |
| **Suboptimal detection method** | Uses autocorrelation instead of matched filtering to reduce computation. | Less robust at low SNR; matched filtering would perform better but requires more processing. |

# 📡 IEEE 802.11a OFDM Receiver – Week 3 Notes

## Understand the OFDM Sync Long block

- The OFDM Sync Long block performs applies frequency offset correction and symbol alignment. This is required because the sender and the receiver might work on slightly different frequencies.

## Understand the algorithm for frequency offset correction


- **Where is the frequency offset correction algorithm implemented?**  
  - The frequency offset correction is implemented inside the GNU Radio block OFDM Sync Long, which is part of the receiver chain described in Section 2.3 of the article.
  
  - This block This block operates immediately after frame detection and before the FFT stage and is responsible for:
     - Estimating the frequency offset between the sender and the receiver, using the short training sequence.
     - Applying the correction to each incoming sample by multiplying it with the complex exponential exp(i * n * df)
     - Performing symbol alignment using matched filtering with the long training sequence


- **Which parameters could you vary?**  
Averaging window length (N_short):  Controls how many samples are used for the sum, $$s[n] \cdot \overline{s[n+16]}$$
    - Smaller window → faster reaction, more sensitive to noise.

Peak detection thresholds
- Used during matched filtering of the long training sequence
- Changing these thresholds affects symbol alignment sensitivity.

Why is there a delayed input? Could you change that value and what would the impact be of doing that?

Why the delayed input exists?
The frequency offset estimator requires multiplying a sample with another sample 16 positions later:

$$df = \frac{1}{16} \, \arg \left( \sum_{n=0}^{N_{\text{short}}-1-16} s[n] \, \overline{s[n+16]} \right)$$

This requires a delay line of exactly 16 samples inside the block.
Additionally, symbol alignment requires buffering 64 samples to perform matched filtering with the long training sequence.

#### Can you change the delay?
You can change it in code, but the algorithm depends on the exact periodicity of the OFDM preamble.
Changing the delay breaks the core assumption that the short training sequence repeats every 16 samples.

Impact of changing the delay

If the delay is modified:

- The correlation peak disappears.
- Frequency offset estimation becomes incorrect.
- Symbol alignment fails.
- FFT window is misaligned.
- The receiver fails to decode frames (PDR approaches zero).

  
 # 📡 IEEE 802.11a OFDM Receiver – Week 4 Notes
## 1. How is symbol alignment done (algorithm logic)?

Symbol alignment is performed using the Long Training Sequence (LTS), which is a known 64-sample pattern repeated 2.5 times in the IEEE 802.11 preamble. The receiver computes a matched filter (correlation) between the incoming samples and the known 64-sample LTS pattern:

$$
NP = argmax_3 \left( \sum_{k=0}^{63} s[n+k] \cdot \overline{LT[k]} \right)
$$

This correlation produces several sharp peaks. The block selects the three largest peaks, since the LTS contains 2.5 repetitions.

LTS = [64 samples] [64 samples] [half 64 samples], illustrated in figure 1 (G12,T0,T1). The last peak corresponds to the start of the final LTS symbol.

The indices of the three peaks, NP = [n1, n2, n3] are calculated by:

$$
NP = argmax_3 \left( \sum_{k=0}^{63} s[n+k] \cdot \overline{LT[k]} \right)
$$

Once this index is known, the receiver knows the exact position of the first OFDM data symbol. Each symbol is then extracted by removing the 16-sample cyclic prefix (CP) and keeping the next 64 samples for the FFT, as showed in figure 1 in OFDM Symbols section.

<img width="1147" height="191" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cffa6a8-42be-459a-b608-db291c35dc40" />

## 2. Why is matched filtering used for symbol alignment but not for frame detection?

- Frame detection uses the Short Training Sequence (STS), which consists of 10 repetitions of a 16-sample pattern. Because this sequence is highly repetitive, autocorrelation is enough to detect it reliably. Autocorrelation is also much cheaper computationally, which is necessary since frame detection must run at the full sample rate (10–20 Msps).

- Symbol alignment, in contrast, must be extremely precise. The 64-sample LTS has a unique structure that produces narrow, unambiguous peaks when matched filtering is applied. Autocorrelation does not provide the required timing accuracy for FFT alignment.

## 3. Code implementing equation (6)

$$
NP = argmax_3 \left( \sum_{k=0}^{63} s[n+k] \cdot LT[k] \right)
$$

In the implementation, this appears as a sliding correlation window. For each sample index n, the block multiplies the next 64 received samples by the conjugate of the LTS and sums the result.
The three largest correlation peaks are stored in NP, corresponding to the repeated LTS symbols.

## 4.Why is 64 added in expression (7)?

nP = max(NP) + 64

Max(NP) is the start of the last LTS symbol.
Each LTS symbol is exactly 64 samples long.

Adding 64 moves the index from:

- the start of the final LTS, to -> the start of the first OFDM data symbol (as showed in figure 1)

## 5.What does the Stream to Vector block do?

The Stream to Vector block converts a continuous stream of samples into fixed-size vectors. In the context of Section 2.4, after the symbol alignment stage determines the exact start of each OFDM symbol, the receiver groups samples into vectors of length 64, which correspond to the FFT input.

Why this block is needed?
The FFT block in GNU Radio does not operate on streams.
It requires vectors of exactly N samples (here, N = 64 data samples per OFDM symbol).

 # 📡 IEEE 802.11a OFDM Receiver – Week 5 
 
## Understand Phase Offset Correction (Section 2.5)

### Why do you need to correct the phase?
- After the FFT, each subcarrier ideally has a fixed and predictable phase.
- However, in practice a phase offset appears because:

1. The transmitter and receiver sampling clocks are not perfectly synchronized.
Even small timing mismatches cause a linear phase rotation across subcarriers.

2. Symbol alignment is never perfectly exact.
If the FFT window is shifted slightly (even by one sample), the result is a frequency-dependent phase rotation.

- The consequence is:

    - all constellation points (BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, etc.) rotate in the complex plane
    - demodulation errors increase dramatically if this rotation is not removed
    
Therefore, the receiver must estimate and correct this phase offset for every OFDM symbol.

### Find the code that estimates the phase offset 

- The phase offset is estimated in the block OFDM Equalize Symbols.

- The algorithm uses the four pilot subcarriers defined by IEEE 802.11.
- Each pilot subcarrier carries a known BPSK symbol (±1), but the pilot pattern changes with the symbol index.

- The code does:
1. Extract the four pilot subcarriers from the current OFDM symbol.
2.Compare the received pilot phase with the expected pilot phase.
3. Perform a linear regression over pilot subcarrier indices because the phase offset is linear in frequency.
4. Estimate the slope and intercept of the phase rotation across all subcarriers.

- This slope/intercept pair gives the phase correction function for the entire OFDM symbol.

  ### How are you correcting the phase? (Which values are being changed?)

- The correction is applied directly to the frequency-domain subcarrier symbols after the FFT.

- Let:

  - X[k] = received subcarrier at index k

  - ϕ(k) = estimated phase rotation at that subcarrier

  - X_corr[k] = corrected subcarrier

- The correction is:
   X_corr[k] = X[k] * exp(-j * ϕ(k))
- What is being changed?

   - The angle of each complex subcarrier value is rotated back to where it should be.
   - The magnitude is not changed (only the phase).

- Since ϕ(k) is linear with frequency:
    ϕ(k) = slope * k + intercept
- This precisely removes the accumulated phase error across all 48 data subcarriers.
- After correction, the constellation points lie again on the expected positions, enabling correct demodulation

   # 📡 IEEE 802.11a OFDM Receiver – Week 6

## Understand the OFDM Equalize Symbols module 
### What does it do?

-The OFDM Equalize Symbols block is the first block operating in the frequency domain after the FFT. It performs the following functions:
1. Phase offset correction using the four pilot subcarriers.
2.Channel magnitude correction (simple equalization based on a sinc-shaped assumption).
3. Removal of DC, guard, and pilot subcarriers.
4. Extraction of the 48 data subcarriers from the 64-point FFT output.
5. Preparation of clean frequency-domain symbols for demodulation in the OFDM Decode Signal block.

- In short, this block “cleans” the FFT output and makes the data symbols ready for decoding.

### Why is the implementation limited to deal with BPSK and QPSK modulation?

- The limitation comes from the simplified channel equalization used:

- The current implementation assumes a sinc-shaped magnitude response of the subcarriers.

- This approximation is not accurate enough for constellations where amplitude carries important information (e.g., 16-QAM, 64-QAM).

- Incorrect magnitude equalization would distort these constellations and make decoding unreliable.

- BPSK and QPSK depend mostly on phase, so the simplified equalizer works well enough for them.
- Higher-order QAM requires more advanced channel estimation, which is not implemented.

 ### Which other functions are performed in this block?

- Besides equalization, the block also:

    - Uses pilot subcarriers to estimate and correct linear phase offset.
    - Removes non-data carriers (DC, guard bands, pilots).
    - Normalizes and outputs only the 48 data subcarriers.
    - Propagates tags such as the symbol index, needed for pilot tracking.
    - Passes corrected symbols to OFDM Decode Signal for demapping and decoding.

 ## Work through Section 2.7

# Section 2.7 — Signal Field Decoding 
# How does an 802.11 frame begin?

An 802.11 OFDM frame always starts in this order:

1. **STS** – short training sequence used only to detect that a frame is arriving.  
2. **LTS** – long training sequence used to find the exact start of the symbols.  
3. **SIGNAL Field** – the first symbol that contains useful information for the receiver.  
4. **DATA Field** – the MAC header and payload.

So, the SIGNAL field is the first symbol that tells the receiver how to read the rest of the frame.

# How do you delimit a frame? (Remembering Computer Networks)
INCOMPLETE 

# What is the Signal Field?

The Signal Field is one OFDM symbol transmitted right after the training sequences.  
It is sent using:

- **BPSK modulation**
- **Rate 1/2 convolutional coding**

This makes the Signal Field extremely robust, since it must always be decoded correctly for the frame to be understood.

The Signal Field contains:

- **RATE** → modulation and coding used for the payload  
- **LENGTH** → number of bytes in the payload  
- **1 parity bit** → quick correctness check  
- **6 tail bits** → flushes the convolutional decoder  


# Why is this necessary?

The receiver cannot decode the payload unless it knows:

- the modulation (BPSK/QPSK/QAM)  
- the coding rate  
- the total payload length  

The SIGNAL field conveys the essential PHY-layer transmission parameters —  
namely the modulation scheme, convolutional coding rate, and PSDU length —  
allowing the physical layer to correctly configure its demodulation and decoding pipelines  
for the subsequent OFDM data symbols.


# How is that information encoded?
The Signal Field consists of 24 bits:
- 4 bits  → RATE (modulation + coding of the payload)
- 12 bits → LENGTH (payload size in bytes)
- 1 bit   → Parity
- 6 bits  → Tail bits (flush the convolutional encoder)


  
Then:
1. Convolutionally encoded (rate 1/2), producing 48 coded bits
2. Interleaved to improve robustness against burst errors
3. Modulated using BPSK (each bit → +1 or –1)
4. Mapped onto a single OFDM symbol (48 data subcarriers)


   # 📡 IEEE 802.11a OFDM Receiver – Week 7

## Work through decoding the payload (Section 2.8)

### Which abstract receiver blocks are within the module OFDM Decode MAC?

Before reaching the **OFDM Decode MAC** module, the receiver has already converted the RF waveform into corrected, equalized OFDM data symbols.

Inside this block, the receiver performs the **final digital baseband reconstruction of the payload**.  
According to Section 2.8 of the article, the *OFDM Decode MAC* module contains the following abstract processing blocks:

#### **Demodulator**
- Converts each of the **48 constellation points** into **soft bits** based on the modulation scheme (BPSK, QPSK, etc.).

#### **De-interleaver**
- Reverses the bit permutations applied at the transmitter, according to the **Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)**.

#### **Convolutional Decoder + Puncturing Handler**
- Performs **Viterbi decoding** (using the IT++ library) to correct channel errors and reconstruct punctured bits.

#### **Descrambler**
- Uses the first **seven bits of the SERVICE field** (which are always zero) to determine the scrambler's initial state and remove the scrambling sequence.
  
Together, these operations reconstruct the **original MAC-layer payload** from the equalized OFDM symbols.

---
### How many constellation symbols are demodulated at once? Why?

The block demodulates **48 constellation symbols at once**, because each OFDM symbol contains:

- 64 total subcarriers  
  Subtracting:
  - 4 pilot carriers  
  - 1 DC carrier  
  - 11 guard/null carriers  

→ leaves **48 data subcarriers**, each carrying one constellation point.

This number is **defined by the IEEE 802.11a/g/p standard**, so it cannot be freely changed.


#### Can this be changed?

Technically yes, one could modify the GNU Radio implementation.  
However, doing so would **break compliance with the 802.11 standard**, and the receiver would no longer correctly interpret WiFi frames.

#### Impact of changing the number of demodulated carriers

- Demodulation would no longer match the transmitter's OFDM structure.  
- De-interleaving and Viterbi decoding would receive the wrong number of bits.  
- Descrambling would fail since the bitstream structure becomes invalid.  
- **Frame decoding would fail completely.**

Therefore, the receiver **must demodulate exactly 48 symbols per OFDM symbol** to remain compliant with IEEE 802.11a/g/p.

---
### What is the actual process of digital demodulation?

#### **Input**
A vector of **48 complex constellation points**, already equalized and phase-corrected.

#### **Output**
A vector of **soft bits** — floating-point values representing the likelihood of each bit being 0 or 1.

#### **How the Conversion Works**

1. Each constellation point is compared to the ideal constellation positions defined by the modulation scheme  
   (e.g., BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM).

2. The distance between the received point and each ideal point determines the probability of the bit values.

3. For each constellation point:
   - **BPSK → 1 soft bit**  
   - **QPSK → 2 soft bits**  
   - **16-QAM → 4 soft bits**  
   - **64-QAM → 6 soft bits**

Soft bits are used because **Viterbi decoding performs better with likelihood metrics** rather than hard 0/1 decisions.

---
### Understanding De-interleaving

De-interleaving is the reversal of the transmitter’s interleaving process.

Before reaching this stage, the receiver has already recovered the 48 data subcarriers for each OFDM symbol and corrected for frequency, timing, phase, and channel effects.  
However, the bits coming from demodulation **are not yet in their original order**, because 802.11 applies *interleaving* before transmission.

### **Why Interleaving Exists**

Interleaving is used to protect the transmission against **burst errors**.  
In a wireless channel, noise or fading often affects *several consecutive bits* at once.

If these bits stayed together inside the same codeword:

- a single fade could corrupt multiple bits of the same word,  
- exceeding the error-correction capability of the convolutional code,  
- making the codeword impossible to decode.

To avoid this problem, interleaving **spreads consecutive bits across different codewords and different subcarriers**.

This means:

> Instead of having multiple errors concentrated in one codeword, the errors are *distributed* across several codewords, where each codeword only receives a small number of errors — a number the Viterbi decoder can correct.

### **What De-interleaving Does**

At the receiver:

- The **inverse permutation** is applied to restore the original bit ordering.
- This operation depends on the selected **Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)**.
- Once de-interleaved, the bits are again grouped in their correct sequence for input to the convolutional decoder.

Correct de-interleaving is essential because:

- The Viterbi decoder expects bits in a very precise order.
- If bits are fed in scrambled form, the convolutional code structure breaks, and decoding fails.

---
### Understanding Descrambling

#### **Why scrambling exists**
A pseudo-random scrambler is used in IEEE 802.11 to prevent long sequences of identical bits.  
Such sequences would negatively impact:
- synchronization,
- clock recovery,
- and spectral efficiency.

Scrambling ensures that the transmitted bitstream appears statistically random, even if the payload contains repeated patterns.

#### **How descrambling works**
The receiver implements the same **7-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)** used by the transmitter.  
To correctly descramble the bitstream, the receiver must determine the **initial state** of the scrambler.

#### **How the receiver deduces the scrambler state**
The receiver can recover the scrambler seed because of a key property of the IEEE 802.11 PHY:

- The first **7 bits of the SERVICE field** are **always zero**.
- After convolutional decoding, these bits appear at the start of the payload.
- The receiver compares these 7 bits against a lookup table of possible LFSR outputs.
- This allows the receiver to infer the **initial scrambler state** used by the transmitter.
- Once the correct seed is known, the receiver generates the same pseudo-random sequence and **XORs** it with the received bits to recover the original payload.

#### **Which field is used?**
- **SERVICE field (bits 0–6)**  
  These bits are always zero and are specifically used to deduce the scrambler's initial state.
